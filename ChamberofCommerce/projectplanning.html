      <h2>Site Purpose</h2>
      <p>
        The purpose of this site is to provide information about the city of
        Lehi,Utah and it's surrounding businesses and attractions to newcomers
        or people looking to see what amenities the city provides. The site is
        supposed to unify the businesses in the community updating on current
        events and organizations in the community.

      <h2>Target Audience</h2>
      <h3>Persona One</h3>
      <p>
        The first audience member is those coming to conferences here in Lehi,
        Utah. Lehi is a booming city with many big companies established here
        especially around the tech sector and many other businesses. A lot of
        the people who are coming, are doing so through conferences or they work
        in the industry of tech and other buinesses in the area. They'll be
        probably around their 30s-60s, looking for a place to stay a coupld of
        days and wondering what places they can visit while in their stay. I
        think the chamber of commerce should give them a good idea on what the
        city of Lehi is about and what kind of events we hold.
