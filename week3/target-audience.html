      <h2>Target Audience</h2>
      <p>
        My target audience are people that specifically live in Idaho around the
        ages of 20-45 who are looking to find regional news and weather in their
        area. They are mainly looking at the weather to enjoy outside activities
        such as hiking, sports, walking, boating etc. Obviously, people that are
        older or younger can access the site but it is geared more torwards that
        more physically active population.
      </p>
      <h2>Personas</h2>
      <p>
        The first persona that can use this site is a 20 year old male college
        student who are wanting to make the most out of their college experience
        by going out with their friends on hikes or even parties. Enjoy a nice
        ride on the boat by the lake or simply try to take up a new hobby such
        as running. Either way, as an active college student wanting to go out
        and enjoy what the area has to offer, they will need to access this site
        pretty often and have it be a trustworthy part of their college life.
      </p>
      <p>
        The second type of persona is the one that is in their late 30s, early
        40s who is already married and has two kids. She is wanting to have her
        kids have good experiences and enjoy life and as such they like to plan
        activities and things to do outside. Maybe visit the local farm with
        baby animals or go to the new cool playground around the corner. They
        want to find the awesome acitivites to do together as a family.
      </p>
      <h2>Scenarios</h2>
      <p>
        The first scenario involves a guy named Tim and his 3 roommates. They
        have decided to to do something for the weekend which will involve going
        jet skiing to the local lake and after a couple of hours being in the
        water they want to go on a hike. As such, they want quick and clear
        information about what the weather will be like all of that day. This is
        when they will go to Weather Hub and plan accordingly. While browsing
        Weather Hub they will also come across local activities and happenings.
        Even articles on cool hikes in the area. As such, they will find this
        website very useful to their needs.
      </p>
      <p>
        The second scenario involves a group of people in their early 40s who
        are organizing a outdoor yoga event. They include both male and female.
        They are planning on doing it outside of the yoga teacher's house around
        11 am. They will also have food and drinks afterward around afternoon
        time. As such they will need to look up the weather for the morning and
        afternoon. The will also be able to find local events happening such as
        other yoga events in the area. The page will also have other activities
        that could appeal to early 40s active people who love doing yoga.
      </p>
      <p>
        The third scenario includes a 30 year old male who likes to boulder
        around the mountainous area. Him and his 2 close friends who also share
        a passion for bouldering get together, usually at 8am in the morning to
        practive bouldering. They like something simple and to the point to get
        their weather information from and Weather Hub provides that more
        minimalistic look for what's around the area.
      </p>
      <p>
        The fourth scenario includes a family of five whose son turns eight.
        They are planning on having a big birthday party on their backyard and
        are planning on inviting their kid's friends. They are also planning on
        having a bbq in the back so knowing if it's gonna be windy or not will
        be a big factor. AS such they will check the weather site to see what
        the wind gusts will look like as well as the weather. They will also
        check if there are any birthday party stores around the area since the
        weather site will provide all of that information for them.
      </p>
      <p>
        The fifth scenario is for someone named Marie who is wanting to be more
        active but hasn't gotten quite there yet. She checks the Weather Hub
        regularly just to see if there's any activity that she's interested in
        doing around her community. She wants to take a chance doing more of the
        community service and eventually getting around to the more physical
        rigorous activities such as hiking. Maybe checking out the site and
        seeing the beautiful pictures of nature might give her more
        encouragement.
